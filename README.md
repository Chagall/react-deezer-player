# React Deezer Player

This project aims at developing a wrapper react component to the iframe deezer player.

It is already partially done, what needs to be done now is allow for a customization of the player parameters and setting it as a dependency that could be downlodaded from npm or yarn.

TODO:
- Add all possible parameters customization options
- Make examples of each one of them in the page.
- Host the app on netlify
